Hi, my name is Julio Nascimento and I am a recent graduate in Civil Engineering from UFOP. I became a Bitcoin enthusiast in 2019 and since then I have been studying everything about this anarchist universe that involves everything from economics, philosophy to technology.

## Articles
I have written several articles on different topics, including technology, philosophy and economic philosophy. Here are a few examples:

* Technology: "Artificial Intelligence and this blog"
* Philosophy: "Specialization or Robotics?"
* Economic Philosophy: "Interventionism and Economic Cycles"

## Skills
I am well-versed in various technologies and programming languages, including Vue.js, NodeJS and ChatGPT. Additionally, I am always looking to expand my knowledge and take on new challenges.

## Projects
I have several projects that showcase my skills and abilities, including a portfolio website and several AI-based projects. You can find more information about these projects on my Github.
